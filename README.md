CS 230 Portfolio: The Gaming Room Software Design Document

This repository contains the completed software design document for The Gaming Room client, created as part of the CS 230 course. The document outlines the design of the web-based game application "Draw It or Lose It" which supports multiple platforms and real-time gameplay.

Reflection Questions

 1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements.
The Gaming Room is a client who wanted to develop a web-based game called "Draw It or Lose It". The game involves teams competing to guess drawings within a time limit. The software needed to support multiple platforms (web, Android, iOS), handle user sessions, and manage game state efficiently.

 2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I excelled in creating clear and detailed UML diagrams that effectively communicated the system's architecture and relationships between components. This made it easier for the client and development team to understand the design.

 3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Breaking down the requirements into smaller sections helped me understand the system's structure and made it easier to translate the design into code. It also helped me identify potential issues early in the process.

 4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the section on scalability to include more detailed strategies for handling a large number of concurrent users. For example, I would explore using cloud-based solutions like AWS or Google Cloud for better scalability.

 5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I focused on creating an intuitive user interface and ensuring the game could run smoothly on different devices. Considering user needs ensures the software is functional, accessible, and enjoyable, which is critical for user satisfaction and engagement.

 6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I used an iterative design process, starting with requirements gathering and creating UML diagrams. In the future, I would incorporate more user testing early in the design phase to ensure the application meets user expectations.
